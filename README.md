# Super Store Analysis (Power BI)

## Overview
This project is an interactive **Power BI dashboard** built using the Superstore dataset to analyze **sales, profit, quantity**, and customer/product performance across **categories, segments, states, and cities**.  
The dashboard supports business decision-making by highlighting where revenue and profit are coming from—and where improvements are needed.

## Business Questions
- Which **category/sub-category** drives the most sales and profit?
- Which **states and cities** contribute the highest revenue?
- How does performance vary by **segment** (Consumer / Corporate / Home Office)?
- Which areas show strong sales but weak profit (potential discount or cost issues)?

## Key KPIs
- **Total Sales**
- **Total Profit**
- **Total Quantity**
- **Number of Orders** (if included in your report)

## Dashboard Highlights
- Category & segment filtering for quick exploration
- Sales & profit breakdown by **state** and **city**
- **Sub-category analysis** to identify best/worst performers
- Drill-down filtering for regional insights (example: California, New York)

## Tools Used
- **Power BI**
- Data modeling + interactive filtering (slicers, tooltips)

## Files in this Repository

2. Open in **Power BI Desktop**
3. If prompted, set the data source to the CSV file in `data/`
4. Use slicers/filters to explore category, state, and city insights
